This project is an anime watching website developed for the PRJ391 course at my school. It includes comprehensive features and functions typical of a real-world film streaming platform. The website not only serves the purpose of watching anime but also offers a range of interactive and management functions for users and administrators. 
My project was graded 9.1 out of 10 by my teacher.
